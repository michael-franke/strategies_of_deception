# Experiment on implicature use in cooperative and non-cooperative contexts

To run the experiment, download the folder `experiment` and execute `npm install` inside of it. Then open `index.html`. 

This experiment was realized in a deprecated predecessor (called \_babe) of what is now maintained as [\_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html).

A live demo version of the experiment is [here](https://michael-franke.github.io/strategies_of_deception/experiment/).
